I have included my adaptations to the complete BoilerPlate activity. In groups, we discovered that we needed to eliminate some extra spacing that we noticed in the example code. I ran it successfully using PORT: 3000.

In activity 2, I noticed a lot of errors, mainly with just getting things to run. Partially due to syntax errors, I was unable to fully complete everything successfully within the allotted 10 minutes. I'm getting some "command not found" issues, along with a few other things. I've had some issues similar to what Brock's been seeing.

Laravel lets us use dot notation. Just for my future reference.

Activity 3, routes seem more familiar/comfortable to me... I say until I started doing more of it. Will definitely need to review some external resources to make some more sense of file structure.

As we enter activity 4, I have realized that this is more difficult than I initially thought. I have been trying to code from scratch, but am using solved files to help significantly so I can try to piece everything together in some manner. Logic in this makes sense to me, but it almost feels as though I have a bunch of pieces to a puzzle, but not quite a full picture. Having the solved files to look at alongside my project folder does help, though. I think the majority of issues I'm running into are when trying to actually run things. My code looks pretty, but my computer doesn't care. I'll likely have to go over some tutorials outside of class time to really get the hang of it. VSC has been giving me the following error: "Cannot validate since no PHP executable is set. Use the setting 'php.validate.executablePath' to configure the PHP executable".
