I have included my adaptations to the complete BoilerPlate activity. In groups, we discovered that we needed to eliminate some extra spacing that we noticed in the example code. I ran it successfully using PORT: 3000.

In activity 2, I noticed a lot of errors, mainly with just getting things to run. Partially due to syntax errors, I was unable to fully complete everything successfully within the allotted 10 minutes. I'm getting some "command not found" issues, along with a few other things. I've had some issues similar to what Brock's been seeing.
